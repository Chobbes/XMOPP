* Core Tenants

  - Try to be modular. Each XEP should essentially be a plugin, and we
    should make it easy to modify the server to support more XEPS...
    + Preferably we expose a library and people can add their own
      hooks to the server.
    + Plugins should be able to access the XMPP XML stream and hook
      into it.

* Resources for Development

** XMPP resources

  - [[https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0423.html][XMPP Compliance Suite 2020]]
    + Useful map of features we need to implement
    + Shooting for core server
      * May not do mobile compliance. Phones don't matter :).
      * Also might not be too hard, though.
    + This is essentially our high level todo list.

** Haskell Libraries

*** Networking / Streaming

    - Using conduit for network streams
    - xml-conduit for parsing XML
      + Not sure this is a great fit.

*** Database

    - Maybe we should use persistent?

** TLS

   You might want to grab your own self-signed certificates for testing:

   #+begin_src bash
     openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
   #+end_src
